# Laptop Price Trends and Analysis

## Project Overview

The **Laptop Price Trends and Analysis** project aims to identify and analyze key factors that influence laptop pricing. By examining various attributes such as CPU type, RAM, screen size, storage, brand, and other features, this project seeks to uncover trends, correlations, and insights on how different configurations impact cost. This analysis is beneficial for consumers aiming to make informed purchasing decisions and for manufacturers or retailers looking to optimize their pricing strategies.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis (e.g., loading data, cleaning, handling missing values).
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization, especially for creating scatter plots, bar charts, and distribution plots.
- **Seaborn**: For creating aesthetic and informative statistical graphics, such as heatmaps and box plots, which facilitate a better understanding of data trends and relationships.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on various laptop specifications:
- **Features**: Brand, product name, type, screen size, screen resolution, CPU type and company, RAM, storage, GPU type and company, operating system, weight, and price.
- **Source**: CSV file (loaded using `pd.read_csv()`).
  
## Data Cleaning

To ensure accuracy and consistency, the following steps were undertaken:
1. **Initial Inspection**: Used `head()` and `info()` functions to view the data structure and basic information.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Employed `describe()` for an overview of numerical columns.
3. **Handle Missing Values**: Used `dropna()` to remove rows with NULL values and filled missing numerical values with the mean, while filling categorical columns with the mode.
4. **Remove Duplicates**: Eliminated any duplicate rows to avoid redundancy in analysis.

## Data Transformation

Data transformation enhances the dataset for better analysis:
1. **Column Renaming**: Standardized column names by replacing spaces and special characters.
2. **Screen Resolution Split**: Separated `ScreenResolution` into screen technology and resolution dimensions.
3. **Price Classification**: Grouped prices into categories: Low, Medium, and High.
4. **Weight Conversion**: Converted weight from KG to pounds and formatted data types.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase focused on uncovering relationships and trends:
1. **Analyzing Categorical Features**: Visualized the distribution of laptop brands, types, and operating systems with bar charts.
2. **Price Distribution**: Examined the distribution of laptop prices to understand the overall price range and identify any skewness.
3. **Correlation Matrix**: Created a heatmap to identify correlations between numerical features (e.g., RAM vs. Price, Screen Size vs. Weight).
4. **Trend Analysis**: Generated scatter plots to study the relationships between:
   - **Price vs. RAM**
   - **Price vs. CPU**
   - **Price vs. Screen Size**

## Project Steps

1. **Load Data**: Read the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess data to ensure accuracy.
3. **Data Transformation**: Transform columns for better analysis.
4. **EDA**: Analyze relationships, trends, and patterns.
5. **Visualizations**: Create visualizations for better interpretation of insights.
6. **Interpretation of Results**: Summarize findings from EDA and visualizations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run the notebook or script to reproduce the analysis.

## Results and Insights

The analysis provides key insights into laptop pricing trends:
- **Brand Impact**: Certain brands tend to have higher average prices.
- **Processor Influence**: Laptops with high-performance CPUs generally have higher prices.
- **RAM and Screen Size**: Higher RAM and larger screens correlate positively with price, though the relationship varies with specific brands.
- **Resolution and Weight**: Higher screen resolution and lighter weight models tend to command premium prices.

## Conclusion

The **Laptop Price Trends and Analysis** project reveals that laptop prices are influenced by various specifications and brand factors. These insights can help consumers make informed decisions and aid manufacturers in pricing and product development strategies.
