## Purpose of the Project: "Laptop Price Trends and Analysis"
The goal is to explore which laptop specifications most influence the price, allowing you to:

1. Identify trends in laptop pricing based on brand and hardware.
2. Discover the relationship between specs (e.g., CPU, RAM, storage) and price.
3. Provide insights into which features offer the best value for different price segments.

This analysis could be valuable for consumers looking to maximize value or for companies aiming to position their products effectively in the market.
